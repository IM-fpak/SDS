I maintain that anyone who considers what I have written will realise that either hatred or contempt led to the downfall of the emperors I have discussed; he will recognise that some of them acted in one way and others in the opposite way, and that one ruler in each group was successful and the others ended badly. Because Pertinax and Alexander were new rulers, it was useless and harmful for them to act like Marcus, who was an hereditary ruler. Likewise, it was harmful for Caracalla, Commodus and Maximinus to act like Severus, because they lacked the ability required to follow in his footsteps. Therefore, a new ruler in a new principality ccmnot imitate the conduct of Marcus, nor again is it necessary to imitate that of Severus. Rather, he should imitate Severus in the courses of action that are necessary for establishing himself in power, and imitate Marcus in those that are necessary for maintaining power that is already established and secure, thus achieving glory.
